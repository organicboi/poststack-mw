# Dodo Payment Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented Dodo Payment integration in the middleware, enabling the frontend team to build a complete subscription and payment management system. This document provides an overview of what has been implemented.

## Implemented Components

1. **Dodo Payment Service**
   - Created `dodo.service.ts` for interacting with the Dodo Payments API
   - Implemented methods for managing customers, payment methods, and subscriptions
   - Added mock implementations for development without API keys

2. **Enhanced Billing Types**
   - Added payment method and subscription types in `payment.types.ts`
   - Defined interfaces for all payment-related operations

3. **Updated Billing Service**
   - Integrated the Dodo service into the billing service
   - Added methods for managing payment methods and subscriptions
   - Enhanced plan management with actual payment processing

4. **Added Payment Endpoints**
   - Added new endpoints for payment method management
   - Enhanced subscription management endpoints
   - Added billing portal support

5. **Created Frontend Integration Guide**
   - Detailed documentation in `DODO_FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md`
   - Example code for implementing subscription flows
   - Integration guidance for frontend developers

## Next Steps for Frontend Team

1. Review the detailed integration guide in `DODO_FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md`
2. Implement the payment flow in the frontend application
3. Create UI components for:
   - Plan selection and comparison
   - Payment method management
   - Subscription management
   - Usage monitoring

## Development Notes

- The middleware includes mock implementations for development without actual Dodo API keys
- For production, update the `.env` file with real Dodo API keys
- Webhook handling is implemented for subscription events

## Testing

- Test cases have been added in `test/billing.test.ts`
- Run tests with `npm test` to validate the implementation

For any questions or issues, please contact the middleware team.
